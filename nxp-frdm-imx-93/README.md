## 1. Introduction
This guide will walk through the steps to create and demonstrate a Device Health Monitoring application solution on the 
NXP FRDM i.MX 93.  The solution utilizes the AWS Greengrass nucleus lite. Avnet's /IOTCONNECT platform will also be used 
to streamline all actions that would otherwise be performed in the AWS Console. The main tasks that will be performed are 
as follows:  

1. Create an /IOTCONNECT account
2. Import an example **Device Template** in /IOTCONNECT
3. Create a **Greengrass Device** in /IOTCONNECT
4. Setup **nucleus lite** on the target device
5. Download and Register a pre-built **Greengrass Component** in /IOTCONNECT
6. Create a **Deployment** package that defines the **Greengrass Components** deployed to the nucleus
7. Deploy the **Component** to the target device
8. View live data and interact with the target device using **Dynamic Dashboards** in /IOTCONNECT

## 2. Requirements
This guide has been written and tested to work on a Windows 10/11 PC to reach the widest audience.

This contains information about the device which will be used to configure the board in a future step.

<img width="380" height="180" alt="connection_kit" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab693911-aebe-4916-b85d-9d734d067a46" />

## 7. Download and Write the Image
Follow [the flashing guide for this board](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/blob/main/stm32mp157f-dk2/FLASHING.md) 
to download and install a compatible Yocto image.

## 8. Configure the Device
Configuration of the device is mostly automated by using a device setup script, but first the device information bundle needs to be transferred to the board.
The steps required are as follows:
1. Obtain the IP address of the board
2. Transfer the device information to the board
3. Run the setup script

### Obtain the IP Address
* Connect to the board using a serial terminal, such as TeraTerm, and use the command `ifconfig`
* The IP Address will be listed next to the interface `end0`
* Leave the serial terminal window open for a future step

### Transfer the Device Information
* Navigate to the directory where the Connection Kit ("connectionKit.zip") was saved.
* **Right-Click** and select **Open in Terminal**
* Copy/Paste the following command replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address of the board
```commandline
scp connectionKit.zip root@x.x.x.x:
```

### Run the Setup Script
* Return to the TeraTerm window.
* Copy/Paste the following command to download the setup script and execute it.
```commandline
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-greengrass-sdk/refs/heads/main/installer/imx/device-setup.sh -O device-setup.sh
```

* Once the script has completed, use the following command to configure the device information:
```bash
bash device-setup.sh ~/connectionKit.zip
```
> [!NOTE]
> This script will set up the development environment and precompile Python packages and may take around 7 minutes.

* **REBOOT the Board**

## 9. Deploy the Greengrass Component
To deploy the pre-built component, we'll use /IOTCONNECT to create a deployment package that contains the artifact file and a recipe.
* **Download** and **Extract** the *Device Health Monitoring Component*: [iotc-gg-component-dhm-demo-1.0.0.zip](https://downloads.iotconnect.io/greengrass/components/iotc-gg-component-dhm-demo-1.0.0.zip)

### Load the Recipe
1. In the /IOTCONNECT platform, click **Package** at the bottom of the screen, then click **Components** at the top.

<img width="1015" height="84" alt="click_package" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da800a4d-f5cf-4cd6-9438-ccefb5056501" />
